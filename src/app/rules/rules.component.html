<p>
  Equally well known as Twenty-One. The rules are simple, the play is thrilling, and there is opportunity for high strategy.
  In fact, for the expert player who mathematically plays a perfect game and is able to count cards, the odds are sometimes
  in that player's favor to win.<br><br> But even for the casual participant who plays a reasonably good game, the casino
  odds are less, making Blackjack one of the most attractive casino games for the player. While the popularity of Blackjack
  dates from World War I, its roots go back to the 1760s in France, where it is called Vingt-et-Un (French for 21). Today,
  Blackjack is the one card game that can be found in every American gambling casino. As a popular home game, it is played
  with slightly different rules. In the casino version, the house is the dealer (a "permanent bank"). In casino play, the
  dealer remains standing, and the players are seated. The dealer is in charge of running all aspects of the game, from shuffling
  and dealing the cards to handling all bets. In the home game, all of the players have the opportunity to be the dealer
  (a "changing bank").<br><br></p>

<h5>THE PACK</h5>
<p> The standard 52-card pack is used, but in most casinos several decks of cards are shuffled together. The six-deck game (312
  cards) is the most popular. In addition, the dealer uses a blank plastic card, which is never dealt, but is placed toward
  the bottom of the pack to indicate when it will be time for the cards to be reshuffled. When four or more decks are used,
  they are dealt from a shoe (a box that allows the dealer to remove cards one at a time, face down, without actually holding
  one or more packs).</p>

<h5>OBJECT OF THE GAME</h5>
<p> Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.</p>

<h5>CARD VALUES/SCORING</h5>
<p> It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value.</p>

<h5>BETTING</h5>
<p> Before the deal begins, each player places a bet, in chips, in front of him in the designated area. Minimum and maximum limits
  are established on the betting, and the general limits are from $2 to $500.</p>

<h5>THE SHUFFLE AND CUT</h5>
<p> The dealer thoroughly shuffles portions of the pack until all the cards have been mixed and combined. He designates one of
  the players to cut, and the plastic insert card is placed so that the last 60 to 75 cards or so will not be used. (Not
  dealing to the bottom of all the cards makes it more difficult for professional card counters to operate effectively.)</p>

<h5>THE DEAL</h5>
<p> When all the players have placed their bets, the dealer gives one card face up to each player in rotation clockwise, and
  then one card face up to himself. Another round of cards is then dealt face up to each player, but the dealer takes his
  second card face down. Thus, each player except the dealer receives two cards face up, and the dealer receives one card
  face up and one card face down. (In some games, played with only one deck, the players' cards are dealt face down and they
  get to hold them. Today, however, virtually all Blackjack games feature the players' cards dealt face up on the condition
  that no player may touch any cards.)</p>

<h5>NATURALS</h5>
<p> If a player's first two cards are an ace and a "ten-card" (a picture card or 10), giving him a count of 21 in two cards,
  this is a natural or "blackjack." If any player has a natural and the dealer does not, the dealer immediately pays that
  player one and a half times the amount of his bet. If the dealer has a natural, he immediately collects the bets of all
  players who do not have naturals, (but no additional amount). If the dealer and another player both have naturals, the
  bet of that player is a stand-off (a tie), and the player takes back his chips.<br> If the dealer's face-up card is a ten-card
  or an ace, he looks at his face-down card to see if the two cards make a natural. If the face-up card is not a ten-card
  or an ace, he does not look at the face-down card until it is the dealer's turn to play.</p>

<h5>THE PLAY</h5>
<p> The player to the left goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card) or "hit" (ask for another
  card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly). Thus, a player may stand on the two cards originally
  dealt him, or he may ask the dealer for additional cards, one at a time, until he either decides to stand on the total
  (if it is 21 or under), or goes "bust" (if it is over 21). In the latter case, the player loses and the dealer collects
  the bet wagered. The dealer then turns to the next player to his left and serves him in the same manner.<br> The combination
  of an ace with a card other than a ten-card is known as a "soft hand," because the player can count the ace as a 1 or 11,
  and either draw cards or not. For example with a "soft 17" (an ace and a 6), the total is 7 or 17. While a count of 17
  is a good hand, the player may wish to draw for a higher total. If the draw creates a bust hand by counting the ace as
  an 11, the player simply counts the ace as a 1 and continues playing by standing or "hitting" (asking the dealer for additional
  cards, one at a time).</p>

<h5>THE DEALER'S PLAY</h5>
<p> When the dealer has served every player, his face-down card is turned up. If the total is 17 or more, he must stand. If the
  total is 16 or under, he must take a card. He must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more, at which point
  the dealer must stand. If the dealer has an ace, and counting it as 11 would bring his total to 17 or more (but not over
  21), he must count the ace as 11 and stand. The dealer's decisions, then, are automatic on all plays, whereas the player
  always has the option of taking one or more cards.</p>

<h5>SIGNALING INTENTIONS</h5>
<p> When a player's turn comes, he can say "Hit" or can signal for a card by scratching the table with a finger or two in a motion
  toward himself, or he can wave his hand in the same motion that would say to someone "Come here!" When the player decides
  to stand, he can say "Stand" or "No more," or can signal this intention by moving his hand sideways, palm down and just
  above the table.</p>

<h5>SPLITTING PAIRS</h5>
<p> If a player's first two cards are of the same denomination, such as two jacks or two sixes, he may choose to treat them as
  two separate hands when his turn comes around. The amount of his original bet then goes on one of the cards, and an equal
  amount must be placed as a bet on the other card. The player first plays the hand to his left by standing or hitting one
  or more times; only then is the hand to the right played. The two hands are thus treated separately, and the dealer settles
  with each on its own merits. With a pair of aces, the player is given one card for each ace and may not draw again. Also,
  if a ten-card is dealt to one of these aces, the payoff is equal to the bet (not one and one-half to one, as with a blackjack
  at any other time).</p>

<h5>DOUBLING DOWN</h5>
<p>Another option open to the player is doubling his bet when the original two cards dealt total 9, 10, or 11. When the player's
  turn comes, he places a bet equal to the original bet, and the dealer gives him just one card, which is placed face down
  and is not turned up until the bets are settled at the end of the hand. With two fives, the player may split a pair, double
  down, or just play the hand in the regular way. Note that the dealer does not have the option of splitting or doubling
  down.</p>

<h5>INSURANCE</h5>
<p> When the dealer's face-up card is an ace, any of the players may make a side bet of up to half the original bet that the
  dealer's face-down card is a ten-card, and thus a blackjack for the house. Once all such side bets are placed, the dealer
  looks at his hole card. If it is a ten-card, it is turned up, and those players who have made the insurance bet win and
  are paid double the amount of their half-bet - a 2 to 1 payoff. When a blackjack occurs for the dealer, of course, the
  hand is over, and the players' main bets are collected - unless a player also has blackjack, in which case it is a stand-off.
  Insurance is invariably not a good proposition for the player, unless he is quite sure that there are an unusually high
  number of ten-cards still left undealt.</p>

<h5>SETTLEMENT</h5>
<p>A bet once paid and collected is never returned. Thus, one key advantage to the dealer is that the player goes first. If
  the player goes bust, he has already lost his wager, even if the dealer goes bust as well. If the dealer goes over 21,
  he pays each player who has stood the amount of that player's bet. If the dealer stands at 21 or less, he pays the bet
  of any player having a higher total (not exceeding 21) and collects the bet of any player having a lower total. If there
  is a stand-off (a player having the same total as the dealer), no chips are paid out or collected.</p>

<h5>RESHUFFLING</h5>
<p> When each player's bet is settled, the dealer gathers in that player's cards and places them face up at the side against
  a clear plastic L-shaped shield. The dealer continues to deal from the shoe until he comes to the plastic insert card,
  which indicates that it is time to reshuffle. Once that round of play is over, the dealer shuffles all the cards, prepares
  them for the cut, places the cards in the shoe, and the game continues.
